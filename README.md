# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Louise is staring a funding campaign to raise $10,000 for her play "Fever" 
we will review past Kickstarter campaigns to identify trends and make reccomendation to Louise.

## Analysis and Challenges
Data from 2009 to 2017 of Kickstarter campaigns was analyzed. The data was narrowed to “Plays” and Successful, failed, and Canceled data was analyzed.
Formulas for Countif were a challenge to understand. I was able to use resources online to find examples and successfully create Countif formulas. Another challenge that could be encountered is making changes to the Kickstarter data that will change all future analysis.       
### Results 
Launch date plays a factor in a successful Kickstarter campaign. The most successful Month to start a campaign is in May. There is a steady decline in successful campaigns until the end of the year. It is not recommended to start a Kickstarter campaign between December and March. For campaigns that are less then $10,000 there are more successful campaigns than failures. Above $15,000 has a higher failure rate and is not recommended for a Kickstarter campaign.
